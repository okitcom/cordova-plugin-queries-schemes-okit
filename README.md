## App Queries Schemes Plugin for Apache Cordova

Cordova / PhoneGap Plugin to work arround Apple's iOS9 requirement that URL Schemes be declared and submitted to Apple (via Info.plist file).

In short, this plugin just whitelists the Url Scheme of the most popular apps on iOS so they will open when linked to. **This is a work around**.
